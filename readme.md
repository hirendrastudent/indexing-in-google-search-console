Here is a Python script that you can use to automatically scrape the URLs from your sitemap and submit them to Google Search Console for indexing:



To use this script, you will need to replace YOUR_SITEMAP_URL with the URL of your sitemap, and YOUR_SEARCH_CONSOLE_API_KEY with your Google Search Console API key. You can obtain an API key by following the instructions in the Google Search Console API documentation.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
